## Components & Purpose

- **Firewalls (3)**
  1. Between the Internet and Load Balancer.
  2. Between Load Balancer and Web/App servers.
  3. Between Web/App servers and Database.

- **SSL Certificate**
  - Enables HTTPS for secure, encrypted communication.
  - Protects against eavesdropping and MITM attacks.

- **Monitoring Clients (3)**
  - Installed on Load Balancer, Web/App server, and Database.
  - Collect logs and metrics for performance and security monitoring.

## Why HTTPS?
- Encrypts data in transit.
- Prevents interception of sensitive information.

## Why Monitoring?
- Detects failures early.
- Tracks performance metrics (CPU, Memory, QPS).
- Sends alerts for anomalies.

## How Monitoring Works
- Agents collect metrics/logs locally.
- Data sent to central monitoring platform (Sumo Logic, Datadog, Prometheus, etc.).

## Monitoring QPS
- Configure agent to parse Nginx/HAProxy logs.
- Track HTTP request rates and set alert thresholds.

## Issues in This Setup
1. **SSL Termination at Load Balancer**
   - Traffic from Load Balancer to backend is unencrypted.

2. **Single Write-Capable MySQL Server**
   - Primary DB failure blocks writes.

3. **Identical Servers (DB + App + Web)**
   - Breach or overload on one can affect all.
