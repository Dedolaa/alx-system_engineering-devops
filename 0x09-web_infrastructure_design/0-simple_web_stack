# Simple Web Stack

## Infrastructure Diagram

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DXDnq3a1E48AqRv8ZBdcqEaqp4L4A7Kr/view?usp=drivesdk


## Components

1. **Server**
   - A physical or virtual machine with IP `8.8.8.8` hosting all components.

2. **Domain Name**
   - `foobar.com` maps to `8.8.8.8`.
   - `www` is an **A record** pointing to the server IP.

3. **Web Server (Nginx)**
   - Handles HTTP requests.
   - Serves static content.
   - Forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

4. **Application Server**
   - Runs the backend application logic (e.g., PHP-FPM, Gunicorn).
   - Connects to the database to fetch/store data.

5. **Application Files**
   - Website code base (HTML, CSS, JS, backend scripts).

6. **Database (MySQL)**
   - Stores structured application data.

7. **Communication**
   - Server and user communicate via HTTP/HTTPS over TCP/IP.

## Issues with This Infrastructure

1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**
   - One server crash takes the whole site down.

2. **Downtime During Maintenance**
   - Restarting or updating the server interrupts service.

3. **No Scalability**
   - Cannot handle heavy traffic or sudden spikes.
