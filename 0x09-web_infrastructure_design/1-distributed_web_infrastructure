## Components & Purpose

- **Server 1 & Server 2**
  - Host the web server (Nginx), application server, and application files.
  - Provide redundancy and share traffic.

- **Load Balancer (HAProxy)**
  - Distributes incoming requests across servers.
  - Uses **Round Robin** algorithm: sends each request to the next server in order.
  - **Active–Active** setup: both servers process requests.

- **Primary–Replica Database (MySQL)**
  - Primary handles all writes and updates.
  - Replica handles reads and can take over if Primary fails.

## Issues

1. **Single Point of Failure**
   - Load balancer failure brings down the site.

2. **Security**
   - No firewall, no HTTPS encryption.

3. **No Monitoring**
   - No alerts for downtime or performance degradation.
